"""
Feature: Sensitivity Mapping
============================

Bayesian model comparison allows us to take a dataset, fit it with multiple models and use the Bayesian evidence to
quantify which model objectively gives the best-fit following the principles of Occam's Razor.

However, a complex model may not be favoured by model comparison not because it is the 'wrong' model, but simply
because the dataset being fitted is not of a sufficient quality for the more complex model to be favoured. Sensitivity
mapping addresses what quality of data would be needed for the more complex model to be favoured.

In order to do this, sensitivity mapping involves us writing a function that uses the model(s) to simulate a dataset.
We then use this function to simulate many datasets, for many different models, and fit each dataset using the same
model-fitting procedure we used to perform Bayesian model comparison. This allows us to infer how much of a Bayesian
evidence increase we should expect for datasets of varying quality and / or models with different parameters.

"""
__Model Comparison__

Before performing sensitivity mapping, we will quickly perform Bayesian model comparison on this data to get a sense 
for whether the `Gaussian` feature is detectable and how much the Bayesian evidence increases when it is included in
the model.

We therefore fit the data using two models, one where the model is a single `Gaussian` and one where it is 
two `Gaussians`. 

To avoid slow model-fitting and more clearly prounce the results of model comparison, we restrict the centre of 
the`gaussian_feature` to its true centre of 70 and sigma value of 0.5.

"""
__Sensitivity Mapping__

The model comparison above shows that in this dataset, the `Gaussian` feature was detectable and that it increased the 
Bayesian evidence by ~25. Furthermore, the normalization of this `Gaussian` was ~0.3. 

A lower value of normalization makes the `Gaussian` fainter and harder to detect. We will demonstrate sensitivity mapping 
by answering the following question, at what value of normalization does the `Gaussian` feature become undetectable and
not provide us with a noticeable increase in Bayesian evidence?

To begin, we define the `base_model` that we use to perform sensitivity mapping. This model is used to simulate every 
dataset. It is also fitted to every simulated dataset without the extra model component below, to give us the Bayesian
evidence of the every simpler model to compare to the more complex model. 

The `base_model` corresponds to the `gaussian_main` above.
"""
base_model = af.Collection(gaussian_main=af.ex.Gaussian)
base_model.gaussian_main.centre = 50.0
base_model.gaussian_main.sigma = 10.0

"""
We now define the `perturb_model`, which is the model component whose parameters we iterate over to perform 
sensitivity mapping. Many instances of the `perturb_model` are created and used to simulate the many datasets 
that we fit. However, it is only included in half of the model-fits; corresponding to the more complex models whose
Bayesian evidence we compare to the simpler model-fits consisting of just the `base_model`.

The `perturb_model` is therefore another `Gaussian` but now corresponds to the `gaussian_feature` above.

By fitting both of these models to every simulated dataset, we will therefore infer the Bayesian evidence of every
model to every dataset. Sensitivity mapping therefore maps out for what values of `normalization` in the `gaussian_feature`
 does the more complex model-fit provide higher values of Bayesian evidence than the simpler model-fit.
"""
perturb_model = af.Model(af.ex.Gaussian)

"""
Sensitivity mapping is typically performed over a large range of parameters. However, to make this demonstration quick
and clear we are going to fix the `centre` and `sigma` values to the true values of the `gaussian_feature`. We will 
also iterate over just two `normalization` values corresponding to 0.01 and 100.0, which will clearly exhaggerate the
sensitivity between the models at these two values.
"""
perturb_model.centre = 70.0
perturb_model.sigma = 0.5
perturb_model.normalization = af.UniformPrior(lower_limit=0.01, upper_limit=100.0)

"""
We are performing sensitivity mapping to determine how bright the `gaussian_feature` needs to be in order to be 
detectable. However, every simulated dataset must include the `main_gaussian`, as its presence in the data will effect
the detectability of the `gaussian_feature`.

We can pass the `main_gaussian` into the sensitivity mapping as the `simulation_instance`, meaning that it will be used 
in the simulation of every dataset. For this example we use the inferred `main_gaussian` from one of the model-fits
performed above.
"""
simulation_instance = result_single.instance

"""
We are about to write a `simulate_cls` that simulates examples of 1D `Gaussian` datasets that are fitted to
perform sensitivity mapping.

To pass each simulated data through **PyAutoFit**'s sensitivity mapping tools, the function must return a single 
Python object. We therefore define a `Dataset` class that combines the `data` and `noise_map` that are to be 
output by this `simulate_cls`.

    def __init__(self, data, noise_map):
        self.data = data
        self.noise_map = noise_map


"""
Each model-fit performed by sensitivity mapping creates a new instance of an `Analysis` class, which contains the
data simulated by the `simulate_cls` for that model.

the `Dataset` object above.

This is an instance of the `gaussian_feature`, and it is different every time the `simulate_cls` is called. 

In this example, this `instance.perturb` corresponds to two different `gaussian_feature` with values of
`normalization` of 0.01 and 100.0, such that our simulated datasets correspond to a very faint and very bright gaussian 
features .

We can now combine all of the objects created above and perform sensitivity mapping. The inputs to the `Sensitivity`
object below are:

- `simulation_instance`: This is an instance of the model used to simulate every dataset that is fitted. In this 
example it contains an instance of the `gaussian_main` model component.

- `base_model`: This is the simpler model that is fitted to every simulated dataset, which in this example is composed 
of a single `Gaussian` called the `gaussian_main`.

- `perturb_model`: This is the extra model component that has two roles: (i) based on the sensitivity grid parameters
it is added to the `simulation_instance` to simulate each dataset ; (ii) it is added to the`base_model` and fitted to 
every simulated dataset (in this example every `simulation_instance` and `perturb_model` there has two `Gaussians` 
called the `gaussian_main` and `gaussian_feature`).

- `simulate_cls`: This is the function that uses the `simulation_instance` and many instances of the `perturb_model` 
to simulate many datasets which are fitted with the `base_model` and `base_model` + `perturb_model`.

- `base_fit_cls`: This is the function that fits the `base_model` to every simulated dataset and returns the
goodness-of-fit of the model to the data.

- `perturb_fit_cls`: This is the function that fits the `base_model` + `perturb_model` to every simulated dataset and
returns the goodness-of-fit of the model to the data.

- `number_of_steps`: The number of steps over which the parameters in the `perturb_model` are iterated. In this 
example, normalization has a `LogUniformPrior` with lower limit 1e-4 and upper limit 1e2, therefore the `number_of_steps` 
of 2 wills imulate and fit just 2 datasets where the intensities between 1e-4 and 1e2.

- `number_of_cores`: The number of cores over which the sensitivity mapping is performed, enabling parallel processing
if set above 1.
